To run the game, you must install "VisualboyAdvance".
The actual game file is "DaishaBraxton - LostSurvivor.gba"


--- The Lost Survivor ---

    This is a game where the player has to fight off 
    enemies (monkeys and eventually other wild animals) 
    in order to survive being stranded on an island/jungle.

    Currently, I have 3 rounds of gameplay:
    Round 1: You must dodge the obstacle (3 hits and you die),
    and to move on to the next level you have to "collide" with
    a prachute.

    Round 2: Enemies will try to "attack" you and you
    can punch to kill them. Enemies attack from
    both sides of the screen. You must kill 5 enemies to move on and
    can now take 3 hits from enemies until you lose.

    Round 3: Has the same gameplay as round 2, except you must
    also dodge falling coconuts that are being "thrown" down from above
    from unseen enemies. Kill 10 enemies to win the game. 

    *** CHEAT - Pressing button B will give you "unlimited" health ***

    There are three looping sounds: during splash screen, round 1
    and the same sound is used for round 2 and 3.
    There are also 2 "shot" sounds. One occurs during button A
    press (punching) and the other occurs when the players is hit
    by an enemy/obstalce. All round's background's scroll.

    Bugs: Player can walk through enemies
    without decreasing health. Coconuts and parachutes are squares 
    when entering/leaving screen
